## Kata Maxibon for Kotlin.

During this kata we will try to find how to use property based testing from different points of view:

* Using [TDD][tdd].


## Getting started

Jobandtalent developers love ice cream. And one of our favorites ice cream is named Maxibon:

![Maxibon][maxibon]

Summer is comming and our small team sometime needs Maxibons to work better. But in the Jobandtalent HQs finding a Maxibon is not always easy. We start every week with 10 Maxibons but once there are just 2 Maxibons or less we need to buy more.

Jobandtalent developers can consume zero or a positive number of maxibons. The Jobandtalent team is 
composed by five engineers and everytime some of these engineers go to the kitchen they grab some maxibons as follows:

* If the developer is Marcos, he grabs three maxibons.
* If the developer is Edu, he grabs one maxibon.
* If the developer is Luis, he does not grab any maxibon.
* If the developer is Chema, he grabs two maxibons.
* If the developer is RÃºben, he grabs one maxibon.

When a Jobandtalent engineer goes to the kitchen, they can go in group if needed, and there are just 2 maxibons or less left he has to send a message through the Slack API saying ``"Hi guys, I'm <NAME OF THE DEVELOPER>. We need more maxibons!"``. And the number of maxibons available will be automatically incremented by 10 :). If the number of maxibons left is lower than the number of maxibons the developer tries to get he will get just the number of maxibons available.

## Tasks

Your task as Developer is to resolve this problem or test an already implemented software, 
depending on the path you have choosen before to start.

* If you want to practice TDD write a little piece of software to implement the already described scenario following the TDD cycle.

## Extra tasks:

* Change the initial number of maxibons to be configurable.
* Add the verbose modifier to the properties to review if the generation is working fine.
* Change your production code to check if your tests fail or not.
* Configure the number of generations used per property.

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**
